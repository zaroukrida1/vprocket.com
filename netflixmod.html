        <h2>What is Netflix?</h2>
        <p>Netflix is an application for watching movies online that originated in the US. This streaming movie service was first launched in 1997 by Netflix INC and began offering a paid subscription plan in 1999.</p>
        <p>The company previously specialized in DVD rentals of movies and other content. But after transforming into an app and operating entirely online, Netflix was one of the pioneers, quickly becoming one of the world’s largest, most prestigious, and quality streaming services.</p>
        <p>Netflix is now available globally (except for some countries with strict communication policies such as China, North Korea).</p>

        <p>Every year Netflix releases dozens of movies, TV shows, and documentaries of high quality. These works often target user trends and feature famous directors, veteran actors, great scripts, and excellent cinematography.</p>
